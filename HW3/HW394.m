% Observation:
%   This formula of fixed point method cannot provide the answer with
% negative initial point, since when the initial value x0 is negative and
% the value of A is positve recursive formula will do the approximation in 
% the negative approach which will approximate the answer to the negative 
% sqaure root of A which is correct by taking the absolute value.
